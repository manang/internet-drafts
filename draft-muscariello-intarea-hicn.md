--- abstract

This documents describes the hybrid information-centric networking (hICN) architecture
for IPv6. The specifications describe a way to implement information-networking functionalities
into IPv6. The objective is to use IPv6 without creating overlays with a new packet
format as an additional encapsulation. The intent of the present design is 
to  introduce some IPv6 routers in the network with additional packet processing operations to
implement ICN functions. Moreover, the current design is tightly integrated into IPv6 to 
allow easy interconnection to IPv6 networks with the additional design objective to exploit 
existing IPv6 protocols as much as possible as they are, or extend them where needed.

# Introduction
The  objective of this document is to describe hybrid ICN, a network protocol 
that integrates ICN in IPv6, at a minimum cost in terms of required modifications 
in end-points and routers and in a way to guarantee transparent interconnection 
with IP without using overlays.
	
The ICN reference design used in this document is CCNx as  described in
{{I-D.irtf-icnrg-ccnxsemantics}} and {{I-D.irtf-icnrg-ccnxmessages}}. 
IPv6 is used as described in {{RFC8200}}.

There are some basic design principles behind the hICN architecture that are 
implemented by the design reported below that can be summarized as follows:

- (i)  the network can transport many different kinds of applications as IPv6, i.e. hICN can serve
content-distribution or real-time applications, to cite examples
 with very different requirements. hICN is not a content-distribution network;

- (ii)  it provides connection-less
and location independent communications by identifying data with unique
global names, instead of naming network interfaces (locator) or end-hosts (end-host identifiers)
as in LISP {{RFC6830}}.

- (iii) data is retrieved 
by an end-point by issuing requests and a
node accepts a data packet from an ingress interface if and only if at least 
one matching request packet is stored in the local cache of the node, otherwise
the data packet is dropped;

- (iv) basic security services are provided
by the architecture: authenticity of the data producer and data integrity.
A cryptographic signature over a security envelop 
is computed by the producer (using its own private key) and must be verified by the consumer 
(using the producer's public key).
The security envelop can be as small as a single data packet or 
cover groups of packets using the technique of the transport manifest {{MAN}}.

{: #fig-general-arch title="General overview of an hICN end-to-end communication."}

The communication model described in this document covers the transport
and the network layer.

The network layer includes the forwarding plane only and does not 
consider the routing plane. hICN network layer is about using the IPv6 
FIB to determine a next hop router to forward requests 
or using a local packet cache to determine if an incoming request can
be satisfied locally. The hICN forwarding plane takes care of forwarding
replies  by using information stored in cached requests. The packet pipeline
of an hICN node always includes a lookup in a packet cache for both requests
and replies. The packet cache is a mandatory component that is added to the usual
IPv6 packet processing pipeline. Requests and replies carry an immutable 
data name end-to-end, in packet header fields as described in the following
sections. Moreover, requests and replies  carry locators as mutable packet header
fields. A locator, i.e. an interface identifier, is changed every time a packet is sent
to another hICN node. A detailed description of how locators are modified
along the path between end-points is reported in the following sections.

It is assumed that existing routing 
protocols, working for IPv6, should be reused as much as possible as they are. 
Improvements to existing routing protocols are out of scope and might be developed in
other documents  to better exploit features made available by the hICN
forwarding plane. For instance, hICN forwarding plane can take advantage of the ability
of a  routing protocol to provide multiple routes for a given destination 
or more generally compute routes for destinations that are multi-instantiated {{MIR}}.
This topic is important but out of scope for this document.
 
The hICN network architecture can run on top of any link-layer that supports IPv6.
hICN data names are globally routable names which are visible
to the transport layer end-points. Conversely, the transport layer has no visibility of addresses of 
network interfaces.
The network layer forwards two kind of protocol data units: the request and the
reply, called interest and data packets.

The hICN network layer offers a communication service to the transport layer 
in the end-points by means of a local unidirectional channel that we call local 
or application face. This channel is used by the transport layer to send requests and receive
replies or to send replies upon receptions of requests.

A transport end-point is always bound to a  unidirectional channel that is used to
either send data or receive data. The former end-point is called
data producer while the latter data consumer. The producer end-point
produces data under a location independent name, which is an 
IPv6 prefix. A consumer end-point fetches data by using the non ambiguous
name as provided by the producer.  The producer end-point is responsible 
for managing the usage of the prefix in terms of provisioning, association to
applications and its revocation.

The transport end-point offers two kinds of services to applications: a producer
and a consumer service. The service is instantiated in the application by
opening communication sockets with an API to perform basic transport service
operations: allocation, initialization, configuration, data transmission and reception.

The producer and consumer sockets can implement different types of services
such as stream or datagram, reliable or unreliable.
In all cases all transport services are connection-less, meaning that
a producer transport service produces named data in a socket memory that is
accessible by any valid request coming from one or multiple consumers.
The consumer, on the other hand, retrieve named data using  location independent
names which are not tied to any interface identifier (also called locator).
This transport model allows to implement reliable consumer mobility without
any special mobility management protocol. hICN supports communication of multi-homed
end-hosts without any special treatment in the transport layer.
The hICN network layer can also implement robust usage of multi-path
forwarding in IPv6 networks as balanced request/reply flows self-stabilize
network congestion see {{CCN}},{{NDN}}, {{RAQ}} .

A data packet is an IPv6 packet with a transport layer header
carrying data from an application that produces data.
An interest packet is an IPv6 packet with a transport layer header
and is used to unambiguously fetch a data packet from a producer end
point.

## End-points
In hICN we introduce two new kinds of endpoints: the producer and the consumer.
We identify two kind of communication sockets each with a specific API: the
producer and consumer sockets. These socket types are designed to exchange data
in a multi-point to multi-point manner.
In (h)ICN we have the same concept that is applied to a network where memories
are distributed across the communication path. The first memory in the path is
the production buffer of the producer end-point that forges Data Packets and
copies them into a shared memory isolated into a namespace. Consumer sockets can
retrieve data from such memory by using the (h)ICN network layer.
The model just described is an inter-process communication example (IPC) that
requires data to cross a communication network by using a transport protocol.

The way consumers and producers synchronize depends on application requirements
and the transport layer exposes a variety of services: stream/datagram,
reliable/unreliable, with or without latency budgets etc. Independently of the
specif requirements of the applications, producer sockets always perform data
segmentation from the upper layer into Data Packets, as well as compute 
digital signatures on the packet security envelop. This envelop can
also be computed across a group of packets, by including a cryptographic hash of
each packet into the transport manifest, and eventually signing only such
manifest. 

The consumer socket, on the other end, always performs reassembly of Data
Packets, hash integrity verification and signature verification. This is common
to all architectures in (h)ICN. The usual assumption is that the producer socket
uses an authentic-able identity while using namespaces that it has been
assigned. The end-point must be able to manage the mapping of her identity and
the allocated namespace by issuing digital certificates about the mapping. The
consumer end-point must retrieve the associated certificate to perform the basic
operations. It is out of scope for this document how to design and implement a
scalable system to perform such certificate operations.

A detailed description of transport end-points is out of scope for this document.
A detailed description of transport end-points is out of scope for this document
but more details can be found in {{TRA}}.

## Naming
In hICN, two name components are defined: the name prefix and the name suffix.
The name prefix is used to identify an application object, a service or 
in general an application level source of data in the network. 
This is incarnated by a listening socket that binds to the name prefix.
The name suffix is used to index segmented data within the scope of the 
name prefix  used by the application. 

For instance an RTP {{RFC3550}} source with a given SSRC can be mapped 
into a name prefix.  Single RTP sequence numbers can be mapped into name suffixes.
For example an HTTP server can listen to a name prefix to serve HTTP requests.
An HTTP reply with large payload with require the transport layer to segment 
the application data unit according to an MTU. Name suffixes are used to
index each segment in the socket stream.

More details about how to use hICN to transport HTTP or RTP will be given
in a different document. 

### Name prefix
The format of an hICN name prefix is the following:

~~~
|            64 bits             |        64 bits                |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|           routable prefix      |       data identifier         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
      
~~~
{: #fig-name-prefix title="hICN IPv6 name prefix."}

It is composed of a routable IPv6 /64 prefix as per {{RFC3587}} which
SHOULD be globally routable. The data identifier is encoded in 64 bits.
An application can use several identifiers if needed.

From the description given above, the name prefix is a location independent 
name encoded in an IPv6 address. 

### Name Suffix
The name suffix is used by the transport layer protocol to index segments.
The segment MUST be indexed in the end-points and in the network with the same
suffix. This implies that there is one transport segment per IP packet and that
IP fragmentation is not allowed. Extension to allow secure fragmentation are
possible, such as {{FRA}} but they are out of scope for this document.
It is up to the producer end-point to determine how to perform segmentation
depending on the use case. An MTU path discovery protocol for hICN is out of 
scope of this document and additional work is required to extend existing protocols
or design new ones.

~~~
            |            32 bits         | 
            +-----------------------------
            |           name suffix      |      
            +-----------------------------
      
~~~
{: #fig-name-suffix title="hICN name suffix."}

## Packet Format
Two protocol data units are defined below: the interest (request)
and the data (reply).

They are composed of a network and transport header. The transport header is
the same for both packet types while the network header is slightly different.

    Checksum:          Updated using RFC 1624.


The following sections describe the components of an hICN node 
and the packet processing operations.

## Packet cache
The packet cache is a router local memory used to temporarily store requests and reply.
The simplest incarnation of the packet cache MUST index packets by full name, i.e.
the concatenation of the name prefix and suffix.
Insertion and deletion of packets in the cache is described below.

## Forwarding
The forwarding path in hICN is composed of two components: the interest and 
data path. Requests and replies are processed at the hICN node 
in a different way. Both forwarding paths require
a packet cache to be incorporated into the router. The  cache 
is used to temporarily store requests and replies for a relatively short
amount of time.  

By caching a request in an hICN node, the reply can be transmitted back 
to the right nodes as the source address field in the interest 
contains the interface identifier of the hICN node 
having transmitted the request.  Replies are optionally cached if needed.

This means that the interest forwarding path is based on lookups in the IP FIB
just like any other IP packet, with the additional processing due to a cache lookup
to check if the actual reply is already present in the local cache for expedited
reply.

On the other hand,  data packet forwarding  is similar to label swapping {{RFC3031}}, being the packet 
name identifier (prefix plus suffix) the forwarding label. The next hop for the reply in transit
is indeed selected by using information in a cached matching request.

The name prefix in the packet header is never modified along the path for both
requests and replies, while the locator, i.e. the interface identifier 
written in the source or destination address field, for
interest or data packets respectively, is modified at the egress of the router
as reported below.
  
### Interest Path
At the router ingress the incoming interest packet I is parsed to obtain the name prefix and the name suffix.
An exact match look up is made in the packet cache using the full packet name as key.
Based on the outcome of the lookup the following options are possible:

 1. at least one match is found.
 
     1.1. If one match is a data packet D, other matches are ignored, and D is prepared for transmission by setting D's  
     destination address with I's source address. D is passed to the egress to further processing before transmission.
     For instance the next-hop MAY be selected  by using the router IPv6 FIB (longest prefix match). 
     The IPv6 FIB lookup MIGHT be saved
     in case the next-hop can be derived directly from information previously derived by processing the incoming 
     interest packet I. I is eventually dropped.
     
     1.2. There is one or multiple matches and all are interest packets.
     
       - One matching interest has the same source address and I is classified as duplicate and further processed as 
         duplicate.
       - Matching interest packets have different source addresses and I is classified as filtered and stored in 
         the cache.
 2. a match is not found and I passed to the egress for further processing to determine the next-hop by using 
 the router IP FIB.
    
 Notice that the destination address field in the interest packet is polymorphic as it has two different types
 based on the data structured it is looked-up against. It has the type of a location independent name while used to find
 a match in the packet cache and it has an address prefix type to find the next-hop in the IPv6 FIB.
Polymorphism is transparent for the forwarding plane while it has several implications in the control plane.

An exact match look up is made in the packet cache using the full packet name as key.
Based on the outcome of the lookup the following options are possible:

1. one or multiple matching interest packets are found
    1.1. The data packet D is cloned to have as many copies as the number of matching interests including D. 
    The destination address field of each copy of D is set with the source address field of each interest packet.
    All copies are passed to the egress to further processing before transmission in order to find each data packet's 
    next-hop.
2. No matching is an interest packet and the D is dropped.

# Security
hICN inherits ICN data-centric security model:
integrity, data-origin authenticity and confidentiality are tied to
the content rather than to the channel.  
Integrity and data-origin authenticity are provided
through a digital signature computed by the producer and included in
each data packet. Integrity and data-origin authenticity qre provided in two ways
using two approaches: the first one based on IP Authenticated Header
{{RFC4302}} and the second one based on transport manifests.
Notice that the IP AH is not used as an IPv6 extension header as it is appended
after the transport header. However the choice of the IP AH has been made
in order to exploit existing protocol implementations in the end-points.

When using IP AH, the signature is computed over 

- (i)IP or extension
header fields either immutable in transit or that 
are predictable in value upon arrival at the consumer, 

- (ii) the AH
header with the signature field set to zero. We recall that in hICN
the destination header field is not immutable nor predictable and must be set
to zero for the signature computation. We also point out 
the AH in placed after the TCP header in order to prevent any kind of filtering from
network devices such as middleboxes.

                       It is 128 bytes for RSA-1024, 256 bytes for RSA-2048,
                       56 bytes for EDCSA 192, 72 bytes for ECDSA 256.

The transport manifest  is a L4 entity computed 
at the producer which contains the list of names of a group of data packets to convey 
to  the consumer. hICN cryptographic hashes of data packets are then computed instead 
of signatures. The hashes are computed on immutable fields as explained above when using the
IP AH. Moreover, the manifest must be signed to guarantee a level of security 
equivalent to packet-wise signatures.

hICN is oblivious of the trust model adopted by consumers and works with 
any of the existing proposals.

# The End-host model and End-to-End considerations
In hICN the end-host model is very similar to a regular IPv6 end-host with some extensions.
An end-host is capable of opening consumer and producer transport end-points, one
to receive data and one to send data under a given name prefix.
The end-host continues to identify interfaces using IPv6 addresses (locators or
routing locators, RLOCs, using LISP terminology), just like any IPv6 router.
In addition to that, transport end-points bind to location-independent names,
similar to LISP end-point identifiers (EIDs). However, instead of using name prefixes to
identify end-hosts only, in hICN a name prefix is used to identfity a data source.

There is an analogy between IPv6 multicast and the hICN data forwarding path for
one-to-many communications, as the IPv6 multicast group address identifies data that group members
receive from a single sender. Notice that in hICN a data packet transmission stores the
identifiers in the source address field while in IPv6 multicast it is stored in the
destination address field.

Theres is also an analogy between IPv6 anycast and the hICN interest forwarding path,
where multiple interfaces make use of the same
IPv6 (anycast) address. Multiple instances of the same applications can then run at
different end-points to eventually reply to the same request.

An hICN network node behaves as an end-host consumer end-point for the upstream producer end-point
as all replies are forced to flow back to the same hICN that transmitted the requests.
An hICN network node may be able to reply to a request on behalf of a end-point producer,
in that case that hICN node behaves as an end-host for the consumer end-point.
